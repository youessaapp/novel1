# Chapter 1

Sean paced about his room. It was in semi darkness lit only by light spilling out of a table lamp and his computer monitor. His heart beat rapidly and his felt ice in his chest as he savored the idea that has just occurred to him. 

"Australia," he repeated out loud. As he pondered the implications of his choice, he sensed a growing tightness down below. His body was telling him it approved of his plans. He inhaled deeply trying to recreate her odor in his nostrils. What he recalled was not a scent, not a perfume. He remembered her very personal smell - neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just viscerally her.

His excitement grew. Adjusting his shorts, he stalked back to his desk and furiously keyed in Sydney in the destination box. The glow from the monitor shone on his stubble as he absentmindedly stroked his chin waiting for the search to complete. 

He quickly opened another tab in the browser and fired off an email to Sandra; subject line a terse "Hey." Little did he know, this "Hey" would end up transforming him, upend a perfect family half a world away, and cleave lives in unexpected ways.

All this was yet to come. 

He sat back and reread his email. He wondered why he, after all these years, was still giddy like a schoolboy writing his first love note. In a way, Sandra had indeed been his first love. He still vividly remembered the first time he had looked her up in the company directory. A close  mutual friend had asked him to return some money to her on his behalf.

The photograph which stared back at him from the company directory was of a woman with a slightly toothy smile and unruly hair forming the beginnings of a halo around the base of her neck. Even then he had thought her mouth delectable and their first kiss had proved him right.

The search results for flights to Sydney churned and churned away. His vacation was still some months off. He could wait a day or so for her to confirm that she still lived near Sydney and she still would not run for the hills if he showed up at her doorstep. 

More with hope than with expectation, he refreshed his inbox to see if she had replied. Nothing.

His body still thrumming with anticipation, he closed his laptop and climbed into bed. He adjusted his body pillow between his legs. His manhood was wedged between the pillow and his thigh. The sensation was exquisite and uncomfortable in equal parts. He spread his legs and pulled out the front of his shorts. It sprang up and the now the pillow rubbed against the base of his shaft. With a sigh, he waited for sleep to overcome him.

He was already looking forward to his vacation.
