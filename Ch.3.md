Patrick glanced over his shoulder. His office mates had left for lunch. The floor was empty. Patrick leaned back on his chair for a second, then quickly opened a few new tabs in succession - first was Amazon, then came his favorite birding subreddit, and then the YouTube channel of Simone McKinley, a quiet blonde who knew everything there was to know about birding in North America or so it seemed to Patrick.

This was his ultimate escape. Birding had been his consuming passion for nearly a decade now. Sandra, supportive as she was, did not see the appeal of hiking through backcountry only to wait quietly, binoculars in hand to see plumage on a bird and to silently argue with others over what bird they were sighting.

This was his personal vice, one he hoped to pass on to Katie. She could already tell a parakeet from a parrot!

Simone was talking about the upcoming migration season presaging the onset of winter. Migratory birds from South New Zealand regularly found their way up the golden beaches of Sydney to seek warmth in the Northern Territories.

Patrick wondered what life would be like with a beautiful blonde like Simone for company in the middle of nowhere in the Northern Territories. It'd be idyllic for a time. Then he'd start to miss Katie and the Kebab Corner on Duvall Street. He'd have to form a new routine different from his current job managing IT for the university. He'd wake up at the crack of dawn to bird a little then some tea and scones for Breakfast. 

His reverie was broken by Simone imploring him to subscribe to her channel if hadn't done so already. 

“Whatever you say, darling!” he said, first unsubscribing and then resubscribing to Simone’s channel.

The first video ended and lined up the next and the next. Patrick was oblivious as people slowly filtered back from lunch and the hubbub in the office returned.
