Nervously, he whipped out his phone as re walked into the cavernous reception area of his office. 

"Good morning!" his secretary broke his reverie. 

"Morning!" Sean replied, "send Dave to me as soon as he gets in." 

He glanced back to his phone to check if any new emails had come in the last few seconds. He hated waiting the most. 

The take-charge, billionaire entrepreneur in him kicked himself for sending out the email himself and not having his secretary do it. He mentally smacked his forehead for not taking a second to write down in detail the possible outcomes of sending that email.

Long ago, he had perfected the art of managing tough negotiations or situations by preemptively writing down in detail the various good or bad results of a decision he was about to take. Broken down into component parts and written down on a sheet, a big contract or a contentious deal didn't seem as intimidating.

In sending his short email to Sandra last night, he had neglected to do this pregame ritual and now he was paying the price. 

He was actually palpably nervous. 

His secretary walked in, Dave in tow, with a cup of coffee and a biscotti. She set it down on his side of the desk, its white body in sharp contrast to the deep brown of the table. 

"I'm taking next month off," he announced. 

"All of it?" Dave was incredulous, "and the roadshow?"

"You'll just have to handle it," Sean seemed annoyed at Dave's questions. 

The impending IPO had completely slipped Sean's mind. All he could think of was an upcoming birthday and the anniversary of their first official date. 

Years of hard work and bloodyminded attention to detail and he wasn't going to be there to see his company, his baby, debut on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Dave looked surprised. Lisa looked equally take aback by this announcement - her own secretarial duties had effectively doubled with this off the cuff announcement by Sean. Knowing him, Sean would expect daily reports on the status of the roadshow. He'd want to see videos of investor Q&A and it fell on her to collate all this material for him.

This was not a great time to be taking his hands off the steering wheel but Sean seemed unconcerned. He again glanced at his phone as if willing it to buzz. 

He looked up and seemed a touch surprised to find that he was among people. 

"Dave, can you throw together a plan to manage the roadshow while I'm away? My notes, scripts, and talking points are all in SecureVault. Have Lisa grant you read access to the IPO stack," his brain was starting to work again as he doled out orders.

"Prepare a memo to the board telling them of my plans," he continued, "Lisa, get me on a plane to Sydney by the 4th. You know what I like to do on vacations. Just keep one evening aside for a dinner for two at the Sydney Opera Cafe. See if you can get me reservations for the 18th."

"Wait, you're traveling to the other side of the world while your company is out on the road to drum up interest in an IPO just to have dinner date on your birthday?" Lisa seemed shocked.

Dave glanced furtively at both of them, "The board is going to want to know how to reach you at all times. I'll have to include this 'date' in the memo."

"Can you leave this off? I want to keep this evening totally free of distractions. I need this," Sean looked most puppy-like as he said this.
