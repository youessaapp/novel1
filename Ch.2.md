# Chapter 2

“Katie!” Sandra hollered, “are you up yet? Do you need help brushing your teeth?”

Patrick breezed into the kitchen in his pajamas and singlet carrying his laptop. He was running a little bit behind schedule caught up in a birding video on Youtube. Groggily, he reached in the cupboard for a coffee cup, spooned in some instant coffee, topped off the cup with water from the fridge, and stuck the cup in the microwave. He punched in a precise 1:19 on the timer. 

“Still sleeping, huh?” he asked. “I’ll go check.” 

“Katie!” he joined the chorus of people who wanted Katie out of bed that morning. 

His laptop sat on the counter. The microwave whirred and whirred warming up his coffee. Sandra had a flash of deja vu. Years ago, someone else had left the room with the microwave running. Much as she racked her brain, she couldn’t remember who it was. Yet, she saw herself clearly in the vignette. She remembered the smell of the coffee and the bread popping out of the toaster about half a minute after that someone else had left the room. She saw the small glass bottle filled with water and the wispy money plant snaking its way out of it but she just couldn’t remember whose kitchen she was standing in. 

She pushed those thoughts away as a bleary eyed girl walked into the kitchen followed by Patrick. 

“Brushed?” she asked. Katie nodded. 

“What would you like? Toast or cereal?” That Jedi mind trick other parents had taught her - to give kids a choice to pick say green or red jacket rather than jacket or no jacket - still worked with Katie. 

Katie wanted cereal today. Sandra pointed to the cupboard and asked, “Want me to get you a bowl?”

“No! I’ll get it,” Katie replied as she clambered up on to the counter and picked out her favorite bowl with blue and yellow flowers. “Papa..”

Patrick stood up from the dining table and his neck still craned to watch his birding video, helped Katie down to the floor.

Sandra took all this in from her spot near the fridge where she stood fixing lunch for Patrick, herself, and Katie.

“<Ding>” a phone buzzed somewhere in the house bringing Sandra back from her reverie. It was her phone. She had almost left the house without it yet again. She walked briskly to the bedroom and fished out the phone from behind the pillows. A mail alert…It would have to wait. 

She kissed Katie on the top of her head as she came back into the kitchen. Patrick was winding up his video. They had never been a morning kisses type of couple anyway. She grabbed her lunch box and stuck it in her bag.

“Bye! I’ll see you in the evening. Need to make a milk run to the store on the way back,” she announced to Patrick.
